            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Growing up playing in various Texas orchestras as a violist for 4 years 
            before finally deciding to play the bass, Jack has since blossomed into a genre-diverse multi-instrumentalist, 
            but still with a focus on bass. After moving to New Orleans to attend Loyola University for music,
             Jack has since played various shows around the area, and has begun to record and create music with other people as their bassist.</p>
